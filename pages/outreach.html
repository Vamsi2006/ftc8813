<h2>Our Outreach</h2>
<!-- Welcome to the Outreach Section of The Winter Soldiers. Here, we will show some of
our impacts on the community and the world at large. -->
<h4> India </h4>
<p> We went to India to visit two teams we mentored: Domo Arigato and DigiMinds. While there, we taught them more
programming skills, like using sensors, facts about space, and communication skills. </p>

<h4> First Global: Russia </h4>
<p> This summer, we worked with a FIRST Global team from Russia that had a unique challenge; their robot kit had been rejected from customs and their competition was coming in just a few weeks. We connected with them through the FIRST Global coordinator and they were able to send their robot kit to us instead. We spent over 170 hours building a robot based on Team Russiaâ€™s designs and shipped it to the competition in Mexico City so that they would be able to compete successfully. </p>
<h4> Rock Island High School FTC </h4>
<p> </p>
<h4> Rock Island FLL </h4>
<p> We mentored teams at Skip-A-Long daycare and Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Rock Island.
Initially, we hosted an FLL camp with students from both Skip-A-Long and the MLK Center. During this camp, we taught the students
both programming and project skills. Since then, we have met at both Skip-A-Long and MLK each week to help the students move along. </p>

<h4> Company Visits </h4>
<p> We visited the Arconic Davenport Works and met with several employees from the Arconic African Heritage Network to give a presentation about our team and how Arconic
has helped us. </p>
<h4> Events </h4>
<p> We went the the Rock Island County Fair, Mississippi Valley Fair, and Iowa State Fair to spread FIRST out to the community.
Also, we went to both the FLL and FTC kickoffs to present to new teams. We had a float for the Fourth of July Parade with other
members of the QC Alliance. </p>
