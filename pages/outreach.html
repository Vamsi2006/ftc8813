<h2>Our Outreach</h2>
<!-- Welcome to the Outreach Section of The Winter Soldiers. Here, we will show some of
our impacts on the community and the world at large. -->
<p>We are devoted to making STEM available worldwide through our numerous community outreach programs.</p>

<h4> India </h4>
<p> Last summer a few members of our team traveled to Attapadi, Kerala, India to work with two FLL teams that we had started there previously.
We are proud to say that both teams made it to Nationals and did an amazing job.
<br></br>
While in India, we traveled to Hyderabad to meet the Kriyative Edge Academy and
talk to them about including FLL in their STEM program. We are excited to continue working with Kriyative Edge this coming season.

<h4> FIRST Global </h4>
<p>We have worked with FIRST Global for the past two seasons; the first year we hosted Skype calls with teams from the Solomon Islands and Micronesia, and the next year
we built a robot for Team Russia based on their designs after their robot kit was rejected in customs so that we could ship it to their competition in Mexico City.
<br></br>
This year we are excited to work with Team Solomon Islands again, and we are keeping in touch with Team Russia in case they need any help.</p>

<h4> Rock Island High School FTC </h4>
<p>Last season we started an FTC Team (#14832 Robotic Radiation) in Rock Island, a socioeconomically disadvantaged town in Illinois.
As everyone on last year's team was a senior, we will have all new members this season.</p>

<h4> Rock Island FLL </h4>
<p> Last season we mentored two FLL teams at Skip-A-Long Daycare and Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Rock Island.
Initially, we hosted an FLL camp with students from both Skip-A-Long and the MLK Center. During this camp, we taught the students
both programming and project skills. Since then, we have met at both Skip-A-Long and MLK each week to help the students move along.
Recently MLK has showed interest in starting another team and we are excited to continue working with them.</p>

<h4> MLK Center STEM Summer Camp</h4>
<p>This summer we hosted a six-week STEM-themed summer camp at Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Rock Island.
Meeting once or twice a week, we did a number of hardware-related activites before giving the campers an introduction to programming by setting them to program a servo-actuated
tilting marble maze with basic commands. The camp was a huge success and the marble maze proved itself a useful asset to show at demos.</p>
